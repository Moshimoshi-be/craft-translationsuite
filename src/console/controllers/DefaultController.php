 * Default Command
 *
 * The first line of this class docblock is displayed as the description
 * of the Console Command in ./craft help
 *
 * Craft can be invoked via commandline console by using the `./craft` command
 * from the project root.
 *
 * Console Commands are just controllers that are invoked to handle console
 * actions. The segment routing is plugin-name/controller-name/action-name
 *
 * The actionIndex() method is what is executed if no sub-commands are supplied, e.g.:
 *
 * ./craft translationsuite/default
 *
 * Actions must be in 'kebab-case' so actionDoSomething() maps to 'do-something',
 * and would be invoked via:
 *
 * ./craft translationsuite/default/do-something
